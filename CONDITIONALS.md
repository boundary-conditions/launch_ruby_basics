# 1 In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 'visible'.

# 2 In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
# Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals 'visible'.

# 3 In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals visible. Also, write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals visible.

# When writing these statements, take advantage of Ruby's expressiveness and use statement modifiers instead of an if...end statement to print results only when some condition is met or not met.

# 4 In the code below, boolean is randomly assigned as true or false.

boolean = [true, false].sample
# Write a ternary operator that prints "I'm true!" if boolean equals true and prints "I'm false!" if boolean equals false.
boolean = [true, false].sample
boolean ? "I'm true!" : "I'm false!"

# 5 What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

"My favorite number is 7" will print because everything is true except for false and nil, so the integer 7 is true.
