# 1 Write a program that asks the user to type something in, after which your program should simply display what was entered.

Example:

$ ruby repeater.rb
>> Type anything you want:
This is what I typed.
This is what I typed.

# 2 Write a program that asks the user for their age in years, and then converts that age to months.

Examples:

$ ruby age.rb
>> What is your age in years?
35
You are 420 months old.

# 3 Write a program that asks the user whether they want the program to print "something", then print it if the user enters y. Otherwise, print nothing.

something.rb

# 4 In the previous exercise, you wrote a program that asks the user if they want the program to print "something". However, this program recognized any input as valid: if you answered anything but y, it treated it as an n response, and quit without printing anything.

# Modify your program so it prints an error message for any inputs that aren't y or n, and then asks you to try again. Keep asking for a response until you receive a valid y or n response. In addition, your program should allow both Y and N (uppercase) responses; case sensitive input is generally a poor user interface choice. Whenever possible, accept both uppercase and lowercase inputs.
